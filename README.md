This project is an exercise completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card) React curriculum.  
A live preview is available [here](https://odin-memorycardlol.netlify.app).

## Overview

The League of Legends Memory Card Game is a React-based browser game where players must click on champion cards **without clicking the same one twice**. Each correct selection increases the score, while repeating a choice ends the game. It uses real-time data from Riot's Data Dragon API.

## Features

- Memory challenge: Click all champions once without repeating.
- Dynamic champion data: Fetched directly from the Riot API.
- Stylized UI: Background carousel, styled components, and responsive layout.
- Score tracking: Current score and best score are displayed.
- Game Over modal: Replay the game after a wrong choice.
